# DWS6 Pilot Build Summary
## Google Cloud Professional Certification Decision & Next Steps

**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Status:** READY TO BUILD
**Cost:** €0 (30-day pilot)

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### **1. Google Cloud Professional Certification: NOT RECOMMENDED ❌**

**Why NOT to buy:**
- **Cost:** €2,000-3,000/year
- **Time:** 3-6 months of study (200+ hours)
- **Relevance:** Only 20% overlap with your needs
- **ROI:** NEGATIVE for pilot phase

**Better alternative:**
- **Self-learning:** 4-5 days focused on Cloud Run, Secret Manager, Pub/Sub
- **Cost:** €0 (free official documentation)
- **Time:** 20-25 hours (vs. 200+ hours for certification)
- **Relevance:** 100% focused on your actual needs
- **Outcome:** Production-ready in 2-3 days

### **2. Architecture Decision: Google Cloud Only (AWS Deferred) ✅**

**What we're building for pilot:**
- ✅ Google Cloud Run (containerized services)
- ✅ Groq API (using $10K free credits)
- ✅ Supabase (free tier database)
- ✅ 2 AI agents only (Customer Satisfaction + Viability)
- ✅ 5 pilot customers

**What we're deferring to later (post-funding):**
- ❌ AWS IoT Core (edge device management)
- ❌ AWS S3 (cold storage)
- ❌ NVIDIA Jetson (edge computing)
- ❌ Multi-region deployment
- ❌ Additional 30 agents

### **3. Domain Structure (Corrected):**
