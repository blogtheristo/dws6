## Why DWS™IQ for Intelligent Industries?

DWS is an industrial platform for enterprises who wish to transform their purpose and operations into **intelligent industries** using Physical Artificial Intelligence and data-driven decisioning.

### To Survive:
- The transition to electrification and H2 solutions
- New EU AI Act and advancing industrial governance requirements
- High standards of the sustainability age

While offering customers leading-edge products and services.

### The Hydrogen Age
Hydrogen age will become mandatory to fight and prevent worst-case climate change scenarios.

### Industry 5.0 Call-to-Action
The new industrial age Industry 5.0 requires significant changes to company production technologies and products. **Using DWS, any company finds it easier to transform into the new industrial age.**

Changing environmental compliance requirements demand action now.

## DWS6: Climate-Intelligent Agents for Construction & Manufacturing

### The Regulatory Moment

The EU mandates embodied carbon measurement for buildings >1,000 m² by 2028. Fit for 55 targets (55% emissions reduction by 2030) aren't aspirational—they're compliance deadlines.

Buildings account for approximately 40% of CO₂ emissions in the EU over their whole life cycle. Manufacturing contributes 24% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, while SMEs account for 63% of all European carbon emissions.

Construction firms and manufacturing SMEs face the same problem: **climate compliance requires constant decisions about materials, suppliers, and processes. Your teams can't keep pace manually.**

**DWS6 agents do.**

### Why Construction Is Viable

European construction giants like Vinci (€70B), Bouygues (€37B), and ACS Group are accelerating investments in renewable energy, low-carbon materials, and green digital solutions specifically to track embodied carbon across supply chains in real-time.

**DWS6 solves a regulatory/compliance pain point**, not a luxury optimization one.

**For construction enterprises**: Real-time embodied carbon tracking across supply chains, automated compliance roadmap management, supplier risk assessment.

### Why Manufacturing SMEs Are Complementary

Manufacturing SMEs in Europe face a "twin transition"—simultaneous digital and green transformation. SMEs simultaneously need to digitalize while meeting sustainability targets, but face structural challenges including limited financial and human resources.

**For manufacturing SMEs**: Digital-green twin transition orchestration—automating the decisions you lack headcount for: energy optimization, waste routing, supplier decarbonization scoring.

### Built for EU Companies by EU-Certified Consultants

- ISO 27001 security certification
- EU data residency (Chromebook PWA + Google Cloud Run infrastructure)
- ROI calculator: €50-100k annual savings through materialized compliance efficiency

### Pilot Program

We're validating DWS6 with 2-3 construction or manufacturing companies in Europe through Q2 2026. We handle implementation; you commit 6-8 weeks for workflow mapping and KPI definition.

**Why now?** 2028 embodied carbon mandate accelerates adoption curves. First movers establish procedural advantage before regulatory compliance becomes crisis management.

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid AWS + Google + NVIDIA

- **Edge Layer**: AWS IoT Greengrass + NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (50 sites)
- **Core Platform**: Google Cloud Run + Groq API + LlamaStack
- **Client**: Chromebook Plus with Progressive Web App
- **Data Storage**: Supabase (hot) + AWS S3 (cold archive)
- **Cost**: $180/month after credits (86% cheaper than AWS-only)

### The NVIDIA Edge Advantage

- **Performance**: <100ms edge inference (25x faster than cloud)
- **ROI**: Hardware pays for itself in 1.95 months
- **Savings**: €27,750/month in cloud cost avoidance
- **Annual Benefit**: €333,000/year cost advantage vs. cloud competitors
- **Offline**: Full operation without internet (critical for construction sites)
- **Power**: 7-15W per device (solar-powered deployment possible)
