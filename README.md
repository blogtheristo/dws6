Key Highlights

Architecture (Updated: Hybrid AWS + Google + NVIDIA)

Edge Layer: AWS IoT Greengrass + NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (50 construction sites)

Core Platform: Google Cloud Run + Groq API + LlamaStack

Client: Chromebook Plus with Progressive Web App

Data Storage: Supabase (hot) + AWS S3 (cold archive)

Cost: $180/month after credits (86% cheaper than AWS-only)

The NVIDIA Edge Advantage

Performance: <100ms edge inference (25x faster than cloud)

ROI: Hardware pays for itself in 1.95 months

Savings: €27,750/month in cloud cost avoidance

Annual Benefit: €333,000/year cost advantage vs. cloud competitors

Offline: Full operation without internet (critical for construction sites)

Power: 7-15W per device (solar-powered deployment possible)

Startup Programs Applied

✅ AWS for Startups: $25,000 credits (edge computing services)

✅ Groq for Startups: $10,000 credits (inference)

✅ Google for Startups: $100,000 credits (core platform)

✅ GitHub for Startups: Advanced enterprise features, 20 seats (collaboration & CI/CD)

GitHub Enterprise: https://github.com/enterprises/Lifetime-oy

Result: $135,000 in credits + GitHub Enterprise + €54,200 NVIDIA hardware = 6 years free infrastructure + massive edge AI moat

Financial Projection (Updated)

12-Month Cash Need: €191,630

12-Month Revenue: €140,000 (pilots + customers)

12-Month Edge Savings: €333,000 (cloud cost avoidance)

Result: +€281,370 PROFIT in Month 12

Investment Ask: €150,000 SAFE @ €2M cap, 20% discount

Hardware ROI: 515% annually (NVIDIA Jetson investment)
