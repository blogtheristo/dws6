## DWS6: Climate-Intelligent Agents for Construction & Manufacturing

### The Regulatory Moment

The EU mandates embodied carbon measurement for buildings >1,000 m² by 2028. Fit for 55 targets (55% emissions reduction by 2030) aren't aspirational—they're compliance deadlines.

Buildings account for approximately 40% of CO₂ emissions in the EU over their whole life cycle. Manufacturing contributes 24% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, while SMEs account for 63% of all European carbon emissions.

Construction firms and manufacturing SMEs face the same problem: **climate compliance requires constant decisions about materials, suppliers, and processes. Your teams can't keep pace manually.**

**DWS6 agents do.**

### Deployment Options

**Two deployment models available:**

#### Option A: DWS IQ Cloud (Default - Recommended) 🎯

**Custom AI agent system:**
- Built on Claude + Groq + LlamaStack
- Full control and flexibility
- Edge AI ready (NVIDIA Jetson)
- **MVP Cost:** €0/month (100% free tier)
- **Alpha Cost:** €50-150/month (50 customers)
- **V1 Production:** €350/month (100+ customers)

**This is what we build and support.**

#### Option B: DWS6 Private Cloud with Rovo 🏢

**For Atlassian-native enterprise customers:**
- Managed service using Atlassian Rovo agents
- Requires customer's Atlassian Premium/Enterprise license
- Deployed on customer's Atlassian Cloud tenant
- We configure and manage Rovo agents
- **Cost:** €200-300/month managed service fee + customer pays Atlassian (~€1,400/month)
- **Available:** Alpha phase (Month 4+)

**When to choose Option B:**
- Already heavily invested in Atlassian (Jira, Confluence)
- Enterprise compliance mandates Atlassian-only
- IT team prefers no-code/low-code tools

### Why Construction Is Viable

European construction giants like Vinci (€70B), Bouygues (€37B), and ACS Group are accelerating investments in renewable energy, low-carbon materials, and green digital solutions specifically to track embodied carbon across supply chains in real-time.

**DWS6 solves a regulatory/compliance pain point**, not a luxury optimization one.

**For construction enterprises**: Real-time embodied carbon tracking across supply chains, automated compliance roadmap management, supplier risk assessment.

### Why Manufacturing SMEs Are Complementary

Manufacturing SMEs in Europe face a "twin transition"—simultaneous digital and green transformation. SMEs simultaneously need to digitalize while meeting sustainability targets, but face structural challenges including limited financial and human resources.

**For manufacturing SMEs**: Digital-green twin transition orchestration—automating the decisions you lack headcount for: energy optimization, waste routing, supplier decarbonization scoring.

### Built for EU Companies by EU-Certified Consultants

- ISO 27001 security certification
- EU data residency (Chromebook PWA + Google Cloud Run infrastructure)
- ROI calculator: €50-100k annual savings through materialized compliance efficiency

### Pilot Program (MVP Phase)

**FREE 30-day pilot with 5 customers:**
- 2 AI agents (Customer Satisfaction + Viability)
- €0 cost (100% free tier using Groq $10K credits)
- Construction vertical only
- Silent pilot mode (observation, no autonomous actions)
- Google Sheets for manual metrics tracking

**Goal:** Prove concept, raise €150K seed funding

**Timeline:** December 2025 - February 2026

**Why now?** 2028 embodied carbon mandate accelerates adoption curves. First movers establish procedural advantage before regulatory compliance becomes crisis management.
