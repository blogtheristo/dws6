Phase,Action,Goal
"Phase 1: The ""Silent"" Pilot",Deploy 1 Agent to monitor unit economics and financial viability metrics.,"Train the AI. Let it ""observe"" ACV, gross margins, payback periods, capital intensity, CAC, LTV, pilot conversion rates, and NRR without taking actions. Compare its calculations to actual financial outcomes to calibrate accuracy."
"Phase 2: The ""Advisor""",Activate the dashboard for Finance and Strategy Teams.,"Human-in-the-loop. The Agent sends alerts/suggestions for viability scores, red-flag industries, and economic thresholds. Teams manually review and adjust pricing, sales strategy, or industry focus based on recommendations."
Phase 3: Autonomous Mode,Full integration with financial systems and CRM.,"Proactive Viability Management. The Agent autonomously calculates viability scores (0-100), flags red industries where payback/CAC/NRR fall below thresholds, and feeds scores into Deal Flow + Desirability agents to avoid bad-economics verticals within set parameters (e.g., payback ≤ 2 months, NRR > 100%)."
