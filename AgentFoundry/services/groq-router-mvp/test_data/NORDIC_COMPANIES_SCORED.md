**2. Regulatory Pressure: 5/5** ✅✅✅
- **2028 Mandate**: Building >1,000m² in Sweden requires embodied carbon reporting
- **Public Commitment**: NCC's 2030 goals include 50% carbon reduction
- **Current Pain**: Manually tracking carbon across 200+ active projects

## Secondary Target: Skanska (Score: 23/25)

**Why Skanska is #2:**
- Slightly lower **Access** (3/5): Larger org, more bureaucratic
- Otherwise identical to NCC in all other criteria
- **Advantage**: Global presence (more upside if pilot succeeds)
- **Disadvantage**: Slower decision-making (needs HQ approval in Stockholm)

**Use Case:** If NCC pilot succeeds, Skanska becomes automatic "competitive follow"

## Mock Data for Sales Demo

For investor/demo purposes, I'll keep "NCC Construction Denmark A/S" as the mock customer data (not real customer, but realistic profile). This allows you to:

1. **Demo the platform** with realistic Nordic company
2. **Practice pitch** using NCC-like metrics
3. **Show investor proof** without violating any real customer confidentiality

**When you land real NCC pilot:**
- Replace mock data with real pilot metrics
- Get approval for case study
- Update investor deck with "Working with NCC"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Approve NCC as hero company** ✅
2. **Research NCC contacts on LinkedIn** (15 minutes)
3. **Draft outreach email template** (I can help with this)
4. **Prepare pilot proposal deck** (I can create this)
5. **Set up mock data using NCC profile** (already done)

**Should I create the LinkedIn outreach template and pilot proposal deck for NCC?**
