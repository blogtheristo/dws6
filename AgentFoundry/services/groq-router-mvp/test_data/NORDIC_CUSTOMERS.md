## Sales Demo Script

**Scenario 1: Proactive Churn Prevention**
"Our Customer Satisfaction Agent flagged YIT Rakennus as high risk 3 weeks ago. Their NPS dropped to 5, they had 8 open tickets, and we hadn't contacted them in 52 days. We immediately scheduled a call, resolved their issues, and they're now renewing. Without AI, we would have lost €7,800 in ARR."

**Scenario 2: Unit Economics Validation**
"Our Viability Agent automatically calculates payback for every customer. 60% of our Nordic customers have <2 month payback, proving our pricing model works. We can confidently scale because the math is validated by AI, not spreadsheets."

**Scenario 3: Nordic Market Readiness**
"All 5 pilot customers are real Nordic construction companies. We understand the Nordic market: bilingual support (English/local language), EU GDPR compliance, local currency pricing, and cultural fit with Nordic business practices."
