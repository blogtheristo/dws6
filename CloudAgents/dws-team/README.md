# DWS Team Agent Suite
**Internal AI Agents for DWS6 Development & Operations**

---

## Purpose

5 coordinated AI agents to **design, build, deploy, secure, and maintain** the DWS6 solution.

These agents are **internal tools** for Lifetime Oy team, distinct from the customer-facing agents (Customer Satisfaction, Viability, Deal Flow, etc.).

**Operating model:**
- Agents work as a "virtual team" alongside human developers
- Each agent owns specific domains (architecture, code, infrastructure, security, reporting)
- Agents maintain documentation, update GitHub Projects, and generate weekly reports
- Humans make final decisions; agents recommend and automate routine tasks

---

## Proposed Team Agents

### 1. Architect Agent 🏗️

**Role:** System designer and technical decision-maker

**Responsibilities:**
- Designs overall DWS6 system architecture across edge (NVIDIA Jetson), cloud (Google Cloud Run + AWS), and data layers (Supabase + S3)
- Maintains `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` and ensures all industry-specific agents (Construction, Manufacturing, Energy) follow consistent patterns
- Reviews proposed changes for architectural impact (e.g., "Will adding this feature break edge AI compatibility?")
- Creates diagrams (system diagrams, data flow diagrams, deployment diagrams)
- Tracks technical debt and proposes refactoring priorities

**Tools & Access:**
- Read/write: `docs/architecture/`, `AgentFoundry/configs/`
- Read-only: All codebase
- External: Draw.io or Mermaid for diagrams

**Weekly deliverables:**
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major changes
- Updated system diagrams (if architecture changed)
- Technical debt log (prioritized backlog)

**Example tasks:**
- "Design data flow for edge AI → cloud sync (offline-first architecture)"
- "Evaluate whether to use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for customer data"
- "Create deployment diagram showing Cloud Run + Jetson + Supabase interactions"

## Agent Coordination & Workflows

### Weekly Cycle (Fridays)

1. **Product & Reporting Agent** generates draft weekly report
2. **DevOps Agent** provides cost data + infrastructure metrics
3. **Security & Compliance Agent** provides security scan results
4. **Builder Agent** provides code review summary
5. **Architect Agent** provides architecture change log
6. **Product & Reporting Agent** compiles final report, publishes to `docs/Reports/`

### Monthly Cycle (Last Friday)

1. **Product & Reporting Agent** generates monthly investor update (includes NPS, ARR, burn rate)
2. **Architect Agent** reviews technical debt backlog, proposes Q+1 priorities
3. **Security & Compliance Agent** runs full compliance audit (GDPR, ISO 27001)
4. **DevOps Agent** reviews cloud costs, optimizes for next month

### Ad-Hoc Coordination

**Example: New agent deployment (e.g., Manufacturing Energy Optimization Agent)**

1. **Architect Agent** designs data model and API contract
2. **Builder Agent** implements code + tests
3. **DevOps Agent** sets up CI/CD for deployment
4. **Security & Compliance Agent** reviews for security issues
5. **Product & Reporting Agent** updates roadmap, notifies customers

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual (MVP Phase - Month 1-3)

**Humans play all 5 roles**, but use agent-like thinking:
- Architect: Risto maintains architecture docs manually
- Builder: Risto writes code with GitHub Copilot
- DevOps: Risto deploys manually via gcloud CLI
- Security: Risto runs Trivy scans manually
- Product: Risto writes weekly reports manually

**Goal:** Establish workflows and templates

### Phase 2: Semi-Automated (Alpha Phase - Month 4-6)

**Automate routine tasks:**
- DevOps Agent: GitHub Actions auto-deploys to Cloud Run
- Security Agent: Trivy scans run on every PR
- Product Agent: Cost data auto-populated in weekly report template (Risto fills in narrative)

**Tools:**
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- Sentry webhooks (auto-create GitHub issues for errors)
- Google Sheets API (auto-fetch cost data)

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted (V1 Phase - Month 7-12)

**Use Claude/Groq agents for drafting:**
- Product Agent: Claude generates draft weekly report (Risto reviews and edits)
- Architect Agent: Claude suggests architecture improvements based on codebase analysis
- Builder Agent: Claude generates boilerplate code (Risto reviews)

**Tools:**
- Claude API (for text generation)
- Groq API (for fast code generation)
- LlamaStack (for multi-agent orchestration)

### Phase 4: Autonomous (Post-V1 - Month 13+)

**Agents run autonomously with human oversight:**
- Product Agent: Auto-generates weekly reports, posts to Slack (Risto approves before sending to investors)
- DevOps Agent: Auto-scales infrastructure based on load, notifies Risto if cost >€400/month
- Security Agent: Auto-creates GitHub issues for CVEs, assigns to Builder Agent

## Agent Configurations (Example)

### Product & Reporting Agent (YAML Pseudo-Config)

```yaml
agent:
  id: "product-reporting-internal"
  role: "Product & Reporting Specialist"

  model:
    provider: "anthropic"
    name: "claude-sonnet-4.5"
    temperature: 0.3  # Balanced (factual but readable)
    max_tokens: 4000  # Long-form reports

  system_prompt: |
    You are the Product & Reporting Agent for DWS6.

    Your role:
    - Generate weekly reports (English + Finnish)
    - Calculate MVP completion % from GitHub Projects
    - Summarize customer feedback and risks

    Guidelines:
    - Use the weekly report template in docs/Reports/en/TEMPLATE.md
    - Be concise but thorough
    - Highlight risks proactively (investors hate surprises)
    - Translate accurately to Finnish (use formal business language)

    Output format: Markdown

  data_sources:
    - GitHub Projects API (task counts)
    - Google Sheets (cost data, customer metrics)
    - Slack (customer feedback messages)

  outputs:
    - docs/Reports/en/YYYY-WW.md (English report)
    - docs/Reports/fi/YYYY-WW.md (Finnish report)

  schedule:
    - Weekly: Friday 4pm (generate draft)
    - Monthly: Last Friday (investor update)

  permissions:
    - Read: All repos, GitHub Projects, Google Sheets
    - Write: docs/Reports/ only
```

## Integration with Customer-Facing Agents

**Clear separation:**
- **Internal agents (DWS Team):** Help Lifetime Oy build and operate DWS6
- **External agents (Corporate Cloud, SiteSense):** Help customers optimize their businesses

**Example interaction:**
1. Customer Satisfaction Agent (external) detects customer churn risk
2. Product & Reporting Agent (internal) logs this in weekly report
3. Architect Agent (internal) proposes feature to prevent churn
4. Builder Agent (internal) implements feature
5. DevOps Agent (internal) deploys feature
6. Customer Satisfaction Agent (external) monitors if churn risk reduced

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should agents have GitHub commit access?**
   - Pro: Faster (agents update docs automatically)
   - Con: Risk (agents could break things)
   - **Proposal:** Alpha phase = agents create PRs (humans merge), V1 phase = agents merge if tests pass

2. **Which LLM for each agent?**
   - Architect: Claude Sonnet (complex reasoning)
   - Builder: Groq Llama 3.1 70B (fast code generation)
   - DevOps: Groq Llama 3.1 8B (simple scripts)
   - Security: Claude Sonnet (security requires deep reasoning)
   - Product: Claude Sonnet (reports require nuance)

3. **How to handle agent errors?**
   - All agent outputs are drafts (humans review before final)
   - Agents log all actions to audit trail (GitHub commit history)
   - Humans can rollback agent changes (git revert)
