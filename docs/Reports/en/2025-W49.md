## 3. MVP Build Percentage

### Completion by Roadmap/Product

| Product/Roadmap | Completion % | Change from Last Week | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| **DWS6 Construction V1** | 0% | N/A (Week 1) | On Track |
| **Corporate Cloud Agents 2026** | 0% | N/A (Week 1) | On Track |
| **SiteSense Edge AI** | 0% | N/A (Week 1) | Not Started |
| **AgentFoundry Platform** | 0% | N/A (Week 1) | Not Started |

### Calculation Method

**Formula:**
```
Completion % = (Done tasks in GitHub Project) / (Total tasks in that roadmap) × 100
```

**Current totals:**
- DWS6 Construction V1: 0 done / 43 total = 0%
- Corporate Cloud Agents 2026: 0 done / 52 total = 0%
- SiteSense Edge AI: Not tracked yet (Alpha phase)
- AgentFoundry Platform: Not tracked yet (V1 phase)

**Notes:**
- **Week 1 baseline**: GitHub Projects will be created next week with all 43 MVP tasks populated
- **Pre-work completed**: Infrastructure docs, operational structure, sales pipeline design (not counted in MVP % as they're foundational work)
- **Next week target**: 5% completion (2-3 tasks done)

## 5. Risks & Next Steps

### 🚨 Top Risks (This Week)

#### Risk 1: GitHub Projects Not Created Yet
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Description:** Weekly reporting requires task counts from GitHub Projects, but boards haven't been created yet. This blocks accurate MVP % tracking.
- **Mitigation:** Priority #1 for next week is creating 4 GitHub Projects and populating with 43 MVP tasks from ROADMAP_MVP.md

#### Risk 2: Static Sales Pipeline Still Active (Zero Conversions)
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** High (100% - ongoing issue)
- **Description:** Squarespace sites (lifetime.fi/buy, lifetime.fi/osta) still have 1,200+ Google Merchant impressions but 0 conversions. Market Signal Agent + Product Page Generator Agent are designed but not deployed.
- **Mitigation:** Deploy Market Signal Agent by Week 2 (Dec 9-15) to start monitoring Google Merchant Server. Create first dynamic product page on onelifetime.world by Week 3 (Dec 16-22).

### ✅ Next Week Priorities

**Week 50 Goals (Dec 9-15, 2025):**
1. **Create GitHub Projects**: Set up 4 Kanban boards (Construction V1, Cloud Agents, SiteSense, AgentFoundry) with 43 MVP tasks populated
2. **Deploy Market Signal Agent**: Connect to Google Merchant Server API, start daily monitoring of product impressions/clicks
3. **Metropolia Thesis Review**: Meet with thesis supervisor to finalize 4 research questions and Finnish structure

**Key Milestones (Next 2-4 Weeks):**
- **Dec 15, 2025**: GitHub Projects operational + first MVP % calculation (target: 5%)
- **Dec 22, 2025**: Market Signal Agent deployed + first insight report generated
- **Dec 29, 2025**: First dynamic product page deployed to onelifetime.world

## 6. Customer & Business Development

### Customer Metrics (If Applicable)

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Active Customers** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Pilot Customers** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **NPS Score** | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Churn Rate** | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Agent Invocations/Day** | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Customer Highlights

**Status:** Pre-customer phase (Week 1 of 12-week MVP)

**Target for Month 1 (Weeks 1-4):**
- Recruit 5 pilot customers (Construction industry)
- Target companies: 50-500 employees, EU operations, facing embodied carbon reporting challenges

**Google Merchant Server Data (Static Sites):**
- **Impressions**: 1,200+ (last 30 days) - Good visibility ✅
- **Clicks**: 45 (last 30 days) - 3.75% CTR (industry average: 2-3%) ✅
- **Conversions**: 0 ❌ **← Problem to solve**

**Root cause analysis:**
- Static product pages (Squarespace) updated manually 1x/month
- No dynamic pricing experiments (A/B tests)
- No feedback loop from market signals to product development
- MVP completion % not visible to potential customers (creates uncertainty)

### Investor & Partner Updates

**Investor meetings this week:**
- None (Week 1 focus: operational setup)

**Partnership discussions:**
- None (Week 1 focus: operational setup)

**Fundraising status:**
- **Target**: €150,000 SAFE at €3M post-money valuation
