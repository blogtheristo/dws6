## 🤔 Decision Points

You need to decide on the following before Week 2:

### 1. Domain Final Decision

Based on DOMAIN_STRATEGY.md analysis:

**Current:** onelifetime.world (frontend) + dws10.com (backend) ✅ **CONFIRMED**

**Alternative:** Use lifetime.fi for everything (simpler)
- Pro: Single domain, email match (risto@lifetime.fi), €0 cost
- Con: Less clear product branding

**Question:** Are you committed to onelifetime.world + dws10.com, or would you prefer to simplify to lifetime.fi?

**My recommendation:** Stick with confirmed setup (onelifetime.world + dws10.com) since domains are already on Cloudflare.

### 2. Legal Entity

**Question:** Should we incorporate "Lifetime Chronos Oy" as a separate entity, or keep DWS IQ Platform under "Lifetime Oy"?

**Option A:** Lifetime Oy (existing company)
- Pro: Already incorporated, €0 legal fees
- Con: Not clear separation for future acquisition/spin-off

**Option B:** Lifetime Chronos Oy (new entity)
- Pro: Clean cap table, easier for investors
- Con: €5,000 legal fees, 2-3 weeks incorporation

**My recommendation:** Start under Lifetime Oy, incorporate Lifetime Chronos Oy later (when you raise Series A).

### 3. Pilot Customer Priority

**Question:** Should we prioritize Turner Construction pilot, or explore other customers first?

**Option A:** Turner Construction (€30K + €20K)
- Pro: Large contract, brand name, proven market
- Con: High stakes, complex deployment

**Option B:** Smaller pilot first (€5K-10K)
- Pro: Lower risk, faster iteration
- Con: Less revenue, less impressive for investors

**My recommendation:** Pursue Turner Construction (already in discussions), but also onboard 1-2 smaller customers in parallel as fallback.
