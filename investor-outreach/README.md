## Tips for Success

### Angel Investors
1. **Warm intros >> Cold outreach**: 5× higher conversion
2. **Show traction**: €140K revenue, €50-100K savings validated
3. **Create urgency**: Set deadline, show momentum
4. **Be founder-friendly**: Standard terms (1× liquidation preference, 4-year vesting)

### VCs
1. **Wait for traction**: Don't raise too early
2. **Build relationships first**: Attend events, post on LinkedIn, share progress
3. **Get warm intros**: From angels, customers, portfolio founders
4. **Negotiate smart**: Valuation and dilution matter most
5. **Choose investors wisely**: Value-add beyond capital (intros, hiring, Series A)

### Grants
1. **Apply to many**: Low success rates (20-30%) mean volume matters
2. **Start early**: Horizon Europe takes 3+ months to write
3. **Reuse content**: Build core narrative, customize per grant
4. **Get help**: Hire grant writers for large proposals (worth the cost)
5. **Follow up**: Learn from rejections, reapply to next calls
