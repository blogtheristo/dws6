## Troubleshooting

### "I don't have time to write grant proposals"
→ Hire a grant writer (€5K-€15K per proposal)
→ Focus on high-value grants only (>€500K)
→ Build consortium with partners who contribute to writing
→ Use AI tools (ChatGPT, ChatEIC) to draft sections

### "I keep getting rejected"
→ Request evaluator feedback and improve
→ Attend grant writing workshops (Horizon Europe info days)
→ Join consortia led by experienced organizations
→ Apply to less competitive grants first (national programs)

### "I can't afford the co-funding requirement"
→ Use investor capital as co-funding (SAFE, equity)
→ In-kind contributions count (your time, existing infrastructure)
→ Partner with larger organizations who cover co-funding
→ Apply to grants with higher co-funding rates (60-70%)

### "I don't have consortium partners"
→ Attend consortium-building events (EU info days)
→ Use EU partner search tools (Funding & Tenders Portal)
→ Reach out to existing customers and partners
→ Join innovation ecosystems (Ecosummit, climate tech networks)
