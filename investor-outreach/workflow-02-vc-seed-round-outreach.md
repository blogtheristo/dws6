**Cold Email Template**
```
Subject: €500K Seed – Edge AI for EU 2028 Carbon Mandate

Hi [VC Partner],

I'm Risto, CEO of Lifetime Oy. We're raising €500K-€1M to scale DWS IQ 6—edge AI
for EU industrial decarbonization.

Why now: EU 2028 mandate requires all buildings >1,000 m² to report embodied carbon.
3.5M companies need automation. We deliver <100ms decisions via NVIDIA Jetson.

Traction:
• €140K revenue from pilots (Tier 1 construction firms)
• 515% hardware ROI validated
• Path to +€281K profit in 12 months
• €135K in secured credits (AWS, Google, Groq)

Market: €40B EU compliance + efficiency market across 8 high-carbon industries.

[VC Fund] portfolio (e.g., [Relevant Portfolio Company]) suggests this could be a
fit. Open to a call to share our progress?

- VC wants to "stay in touch" (usually means no)

**How to Create Urgency**
- Share other VC interest (carefully, don't bluff)
- Set a deadline for closing the round
- Show momentum (customer wins, new pilots, revenue growth)
- External events (Ecosummit pitch, Slush deadline, pilot program start date)

---

## Phase 4: Term Sheet & Negotiation (Months 5-6)

### 4.1 Understand VC Term Sheets

**Key Terms to Negotiate**

**Valuation**
- **Pre-money valuation**: €5M-€7M (based on traction)
- **Post-money valuation**: Pre-money + investment amount
- **Dilution**: Aim for <20-25% dilution in Seed round

**Investment Structure**
- **Priced round**: Preferred stock with specific terms
- **SAFE/Convertible**: Less common for VC Seed, but possible

**Investor Rights**
- **Board seat**: Expect lead investor to request 1 board seat
- **Pro rata rights**: Investor can invest in future rounds
- **Information rights**: Regular financial reporting (standard)
- **Liquidation preference**: 1× non-participating (standard), avoid >1× or participating preferred

**Founder Protection**
- **Vesting**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (standard)
- **Anti-dilution**: Weighted average (better for founders) vs. full ratchet (avoid)
- **Drag-along rights**: Majority can force minority to sell (standard)
- **Employee option pool**: 10-15% post-money (negotiate to be post-money, not pre)

**What to Accept**
- 1× non-participating liquidation preference
- Board seat for lead investor
- Pro rata rights for all investors
- Standard vesting (4-year, 1-year cliff)
- Weighted average anti-dilution

**What to Avoid**
- >1× liquidation preference
- Participating preferred (investor gets preference + pro rata share)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- >2 board seats for investors at Seed stage
- Blocking rights on routine decisions

### 4.2 Review with Lawyer

**Find a Startup Lawyer**
- [ ] Get referrals from other founders or VCs
- [ ] Look for someone experienced in VC deals
- [ ] Budget €3K-€10K for legal fees (negotiable based on complexity)

**Lawyer Review Checklist**
- [ ] Have lawyer review term sheet before signing
- [ ] Negotiate any problematic terms
- [ ] Understand all clauses and implications
- [ ] Get legal opinion in writing

### 4.3 Negotiate Terms

**Negotiation Tips**
- Don't negotiate on every point (pick your battles)
- Valuation and dilution are most important
- Be respectful but firm on founder protections
- Understand that some terms are "market standard" (don't fight those)
- Get multiple term sheets if possible (creates leverage)

**Counter-Offer Template**
```
Hi [VC Partner],

Thanks for the term sheet. We're excited to work with [VC Fund]!

We'd like to propose a few adjustments:
1. Valuation: We'd like to see €6M pre-money (vs. €5M) based on our recent customer
   wins and path to profitability.
2. Option pool: We'd prefer the 12% pool to be post-money rather than pre-money.
3. Board: We'd like to maintain founder control with 2 founder seats, 1 investor
   seat, and 1 independent (vs. 2 investor seats).

Happy to discuss on a call. Looking forward to partnering with you!

Best,
Risto
```

### 4.4 Close the Round

**Lead vs. Follow-On Investors**
- **Lead investor**: Sets terms, does diligence, commits first (€200K-€500K)
- **Follow-on investors**: Follow lead's terms, smaller checks (€50K-€200K)

**Closing Process**
1. **Term sheet signed**: Non-binding agreement on key terms
2. **Legal docs drafted**: VC's lawyers draft full investment agreement
3. **Legal review**: Your lawyers review and negotiate
4. **Final docs signed**: Shareholders agreement, stock purchase agreement, etc.
5. **Wire transfer**: Funds transferred to company account
6. **Close announcement**: Announce on LinkedIn, press release (optional)

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks from term sheet to close (if no major issues)

---

## Phase 5: Post-Close (Month 6+)

### 5.1 Onboard Investors

**First 30 Days**
- [ ] Set up board meetings (quarterly or as agreed)
- [ ] Establish update cadence (monthly email updates)
- [ ] Add investors to Slack/communication channel (optional)
- [ ] Introduce investors to team and customers
- [ ] Request intros for hiring, sales, next round

### 5.2 Leverage VC Network

- [ ] Request intros to Tier 1 VCs for Series A
- [ ] Get help with hiring (engineers, sales, operations)
- [ ] Leverage PR/marketing support for launch announcements
- [ ] Invite to Lifetime™World launch event (Dec 2026)

### 5.3 Prepare for Series A

**Series A Milestones** (for €5M+ raise in 12-18 months)
- [ ] Hit €500K-€1M ARR
- [ ] Achieve profitability or clear path to it (+€281K projected)
- [ ] Deploy 50-100 edge units across multiple customers
- [ ] Expand to 2-3 additional industries beyond construction
- [ ] Build team to 10-15 people
- [ ] Demonstrate strong unit economics (LTV/CAC >3:1)

**When to Start Series A Process**
- 6 months before you run out of money (even if growing)
- When you hit 70-80% of Series A milestones
- When VCs start reaching out proactively (signal of heat)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "VCs want more traction before investing"
→ Focus on customer acquisition with angel funding first
→ Hit €200K+ ARR and 5-10 paying customers
→ Circle back to VCs when metrics improve

### "VCs like the idea but won't commit"
→ Create urgency (other interest, deadline, milestones)
→ Ask directly: "What metrics would you need to see to invest?"
→ Consider pivoting pitch (different angle, different problem)

### "Term sheets are too founder-unfriendly"
→ Get multiple term sheets to create competition
→ Negotiate hard on key terms (valuation, liquidation preference)
→ Walk away if terms are egregious (better to bootstrap than bad deal)

### "Can't find a lead investor"
→ Look for smaller funds that can lead €200K-€300K
→ Consider strategic angels as "lead" with VC follow-ons
→ Attend more events to build VC relationships organically

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Validate readiness (traction, revenue, product milestones)
2. [ ] Build VC target list (40 funds)
3. [ ] Prepare pitch deck and materials
4. [ ] Start warm intro process (Months 2-3)
5. [ ] Schedule first partner meetings (Month 3)
6. [ ] Enter due diligence (Month 4-5)
7. [ ] Receive and negotiate term sheets (Month 5)
8. [ ] Close round and celebrate (Month 6)

**Start date:** [After angel close + pilot validation]
**Target close date:** [6-9 months from start]

Good luck! 🚀
