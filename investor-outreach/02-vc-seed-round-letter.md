I'm raising a **€500K-€1M Seed round** to scale DWS IQ 6—an agentic AI platform automating real-time carbon decisions for 8 high-emission industries across the EU, starting with construction.

## The Opportunity

The **EU 2028 embodied carbon mandate** will require every building >1,000 m² to report emissions. This impacts:
- **3.5M construction companies** in Europe
- **€40B compliance market** by 2030
- **40% of EU CO₂ emissions** from construction alone
- **63% of EU emissions** from SMEs with zero automation tools

## What We've Built

**DWS IQ 6** is a hybrid edge-cloud platform delivering:

### Technology Stack
- **Edge AI**: NVIDIA Jetson for <100ms inference (25× faster than cloud)
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous decision-making for material selection, route optimization, energy management
- **Digital Twins**: Real-time tracking of embodied carbon across 8 industries
- **EU Compliance**: Built for 2028 mandate, Fit for 55, ISO 27001, GDPR

### Competitive Advantage
- **515% hardware ROI**: Jetson units pay for themselves in 1.95 months
- **€333K annual savings** per deployment in cloud costs
- **€135K in secured credits**: AWS, Google Cloud, Groq, GitHub Enterprise
- **86% cost reduction** vs. pure cloud solutions
- **Sub-100ms latency** for real-time industrial decisions

## Traction & Validation

### Current State
- **€140K revenue** from initial pilots
- **2-3 active pilot customers** validating €50-100K annual savings
- **Path to profitability**: +€281K profit projected by Month 12
- **Direct outreach** to Tier 1 contractors: Vinci (€74B), Bouygues (€37B), ACS (€37B)

### Market Validation
- **EU regulatory tailwind**: 2028 mandate creates urgent need
- **8 target industries**: Construction, manufacturing, energy, logistics, real estate, architecture, waste, mining
- **Proven unit economics**: Hardware ROI, cloud savings, compliance value

## The Plan (Next 18 Months)

### Months 1-6: Pilot Validation & Production Launch
- **Q1 2026**: Complete 2-3 pilot programs with Tier 1 contractors
- **Q2 2026**: Production launch targeting 10 sites
- **Target**: €70K+ in revenue, validated KPIs

### Months 7-12: Scale to 50 Sites
- **Q3 2026**: Deploy 50 Jetson edge units
- **Target**: €500K ARR, positive unit economics
- **Milestone**: Close first Seed round

### Months 13-18: Series A Preparation
- **Q4 2026**: Report profitability to investors
- **Target**: €1M ARR, 100+ sites
- **Next raise**: €5M Series A (announced at Slush 2026)

## Use of Funds (€500K-€1M)

### Infrastructure (30%)
- Google Cloud & Groq API setup and scaling
- AWS IoT integration for production fleet
- Edge hardware procurement (50 Jetson units)

### Customer Acquisition (40%)
- Pilot program execution (5-10 customers)
- Sales & marketing for EU expansion
- Customer success & support team

### Product Development (20%)
- Multi-industry module development (waste, logistics, manufacturing)
- Compliance features for EU regulations
- Digital twin enhancements

### Operations (10%)
- Team expansion (2-3 technical hires)
- Legal & compliance (ISO 27001 certification)
- Working capital & contingency

## Investment Terms

- **Round size**: €500K-€1M
- **Structure**: Priced equity or SAFE
- **Valuation**: €5M-€7M post-money
- **Investor profile**: Climate tech VC, impact fund, or corporate VC in construction/energy

## Why We'll Win

1. **Regulatory certainty**: EU 2028 mandate is non-negotiable
2. **First-mover advantage**: Only agentic AI platform for EU embodied carbon
3. **Proven economics**: 515% ROI, €333K savings, path to profitability
4. **Massive market**: €40B compliance + efficiency gains across 8 industries
5. **Strategic position**: Part of Lifetime™World movement (launching Dec 2026)
