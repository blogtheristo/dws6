I'm raising **€150k via SAFE at a €3.8M cap (20% discount)** to finish DWS IQ 6—the only agentic‑AI platform that automates embodied‑carbon decisions for EU construction firms facing mandatory carbon reporting by 2028.

## Why now

The **EU 2028 mandate** for buildings >1,000 m² will hit 3.5M construction companies. Construction = 40% of EU CO₂. SMEs (63% of EU emissions) have zero automation. We give them **<100ms edge decisions, 25× faster than cloud**.

## The moat (already built)

- **Hybrid edge‑cloud**: NVIDIA Jetson + AWS IoT + Google Cloud + Groq API → $180/month post‑credits (86% cheaper than pure cloud)
- **515% hardware ROI**: Jetson pays for itself in 1.95 months, saves €333k/year in cloud costs
- **€135k credits secured**: AWS, Google, Groq, GitHub Enterprise = 6 years free infrastructure
- **ISO 27001, EU data residency, ROI calculator** proven at €50‑100k annual savings per client

## 12‑month forecast

- **Cash need**: €191,630
- **Revenue**: €140k (2‑3 pilots)
- **Edge savings**: €333k
- **Result**: +€281k profit by Month 12

## Use of funds

- **Days 1‑30**: Google Cloud + Groq setup (€50k)
- **Days 31‑90**: 2‑3 pilot validations (€70k)
- **Months 4‑12**: Production launch & compliance (€30k)

## Target customers (direct outreach active)

- Vinci (€74B)
- Bouygues (€37B)
- ACS (€37B)
- Hochtief (€39B)

## Ask

**€150k SAFE @ €3.8M cap, 20% discount**

You get:
- 12‑month profitability
- 515% hardware ROI
- Front‑row seat in the EU's €40B carbon‑compliance market

## Next step
