Hi [Investor Name],

I'm Risto, founder & CEO of Lifetime Oy in Finland. We're building **DWS IQ 6**, an edge AI platform that helps high‑carbon industries (starting with construction) meet upcoming EU embodied‑carbon and Fit for 55 requirements without adding compliance headcount.

## Where we are now

- ~€140k in revenue from early customers and pilots
- 8 target industries (construction first) with clear EU regulatory pull for 2028
- Hybrid AWS IoT + NVIDIA Jetson + Google Cloud + Groq stack delivering <100ms edge inference
- €135k in secured startup credits and an architecture that saves ~€333k vs pure‑cloud over 12 months

## Why this matters

SMEs across EU‑27 face a hard 2028 deadline for embodied‑carbon reporting. Most don't have in‑house AI teams or the budget for heavy cloud inference. DWS IQ 6 runs on inexpensive NVIDIA Jetson hardware on‑site, gives <100ms decisions, and pays back the hardware in under 2 months (515% annual ROI on the edge devices).

## Round details

- **Amount:** €150,000
- **Cap:** €3.8M, 20% discount
