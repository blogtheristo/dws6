3. **Solution** (5 min): DWS IQ 6 platform, edge AI, 515% ROI
4. **Traction** (5 min): €140K revenue, pilots, path to profitability
5. **Ask** (3 min): €150K SAFE, €3.8M cap, use of funds

- [ ] Propose clear next step
- [ ] Update CRM with notes and action items
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for follow-up

### 4.2 Handle Common Objections

**"The valuation is too high for this stage."**
→ "We've validated €50-100K annual savings per customer, have €140K in revenue,
and a clear path to profitability. The €3.8M cap reflects our proven traction
and the €40B market opportunity created by the EU 2028 mandate."

**"How will you compete with larger players?"**
→ "Incumbents offer cloud-only solutions with >2s latency and no edge capabilities.
We're 25× faster with 86% lower costs. Our hybrid architecture is our moat."

**"What if the EU delays the 2028 mandate?"**
→ "Even without the mandate, we're delivering €50-100K in annual savings through
efficiency gains. The mandate accelerates adoption, but our ROI stands on its own."

**"Your burn rate seems high."**
→ "We have €135K in secured credits reducing infrastructure costs by 86%. Our
12-month forecast shows +€281K profit, making this a bridge to profitability,
not just another round."

**"Who else is in the round?"**
→ (If you have commits): "We have €X committed from [Angel Names/Syndicates].
Looking to close the final €Y with the right strategic angels."
→ (If you don't): "We're in conversations with several climate tech and proptech
angels. Hoping to close the round in [Timeline] with 3-5 strategic investors."

- Ask directly: "What would it take to get you to commit?"

### "The round is taking too long to close"
- Reduce target (close €75K first, then extend)
- Accept smaller checks to build momentum
- Increase outreach volume (2× current efforts)
- Attend more events for face-to-face meetings
- Consider switching to VC/seed strategy if angel path slow
