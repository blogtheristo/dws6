1. Go to: **https://aws.amazon.com/activate**
2. Click **"Apply Now"**
3. Select application path:
   - **If you have VC backing:** "Portfolio Company" track
   - **If self-funded:** "Founder" track (might get $5K-10K instead of $25K)

4. Fill out form:
   - Company details
   - Funding status: **Pre-seed / Self-funded**
   - Product stage: **Beta/Pilot**
   - AWS usage: IoT, Storage, Edge Computing

## Email Templates (After Submission)

### Follow-Up Email (If No Response After 2 Weeks)

**To: Google for Startups Team**

```
Subject: Follow-up: Google for Startups Application - Lifetime Oy (DWS IQ Platform)

Hi Google for Startups Team,

I submitted an application for the Google for Startups Cloud Program 2 weeks
ago (Application ID: [if provided]) and wanted to follow up on the status.

Quick context on our traction since applying:
- Signed pilot contract with Turner Construction (€30K)
- Deployed infrastructure to Cloudflare + preparing Cloud Run deployment
- Secured Groq for Startups credits ($10K) for AI inference
- Member of Peachscore (Finland's leading scaleup community)

Our hybrid architecture (Google Cloud Run core + AWS edge + Groq inference)
is designed to leverage Google Cloud's strengths in serverless compute and
global scaling. The $100K in credits would enable us to deploy to production
and onboard our first 5 enterprise customers (construction sites) by Q2 2025.

Happy to provide additional information, pitch deck, or schedule a call if helpful.

Best regards,
Risto Anton Päärni

```
Subject: Follow-up: Groq for Startups Application - Lifetime Oy

Hi Groq Team,

Following up on my Groq for Startups application submitted 2 weeks ago.

Since applying:
- Confirmed Turner Construction pilot (€30K) - launching Q1 2025
- Architected multi-agent system (SiteSense, ScheduleGenius, MaterialOracle)
- Estimated 10M+ tokens/month at full deployment (50 construction sites)

Groq's speed is critical for our use case: real-time construction safety
alerts require <2s latency. We're pairing Groq cloud inference (Llama 70B)
with NVIDIA Jetson edge inference (Llama 8B 4-bit) for a hybrid architecture.

Would love to schedule a brief call to discuss our architecture and how we
can showcase Groq as a co-marketing case study ("Real-Time Construction AI
Powered by Groq LPU").

Best,
Risto Anton Päärni
Founder & CEO, Lifetime Oy
